# Creation Station

Store your D&D characters, add your backstory or see other people's creations.

## What is this?

Creation Station was made as a learning experience. Made to exemplify model relations and give a base for
expansion. My hope is to add more and more RPG based features (e.g. Inventory, Dice Rolls). In the meantime feel
free to use it how you wish!
